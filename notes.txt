Every go project has a go.mod file

1. package main
Every Go file starts with a package declaration.
main is a special package in Go:
Any package named main is treated as an entry point for an executable program.
It must have a main() function — that’s where execution starts (like int main() in C).
Without package main (and main()), Go won’t compile your code into an executable — it would instead compile it into a library.
